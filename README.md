# WBMRI-Image-Classification-PyTorch
Image classification using deep learning models in PyTorch

## Description
This repository contains the implmentation of CNN in PyTorch deep learning framework

Image Classification is one of the basic and most important task of Deep Learning. In this repository, I am focussing on classifying MRI images taken from different body parts and in axial, coronal and saggital angles.

## Download and Setup
Once you clone this repo, run the classify.py file to classify images in your own data/test_dataset.  

```python 
$python classify.py
