# WBMR-Image-Classification-PyTorch
Image classification using deep learning models in PyTorch

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of CNN in PyTorch deep learning framework

Image Classification is one of the basic and most important task of Deep Learning. In this repository, I am focussing on classifying WBMRI (Whole-Body Magnetic Resonance Images)  taken from different body parts and in axial, coronal and saggital angles.

## Download and Setup
Once you clone this repo, run the classify.py file to classify images in your own data/test_dataset.  

`$python classify.py`

### Note:
The current model is trained on a small number of images and a simple CNN but works well with Tesla-based MR images. I will update the loss, accuracy scores, and a model with a relatively large number of images in the future.
